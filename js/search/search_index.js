abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify) but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This allows developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.\n\nThere are superb libraries, helpers, and tools that exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of — Architecture.\n\nFeatures of NestJS\n\nExtensible Approach\nEasy to use, learn and master\nCommand Line Interface(CLI)\nVersatile\nProgressive\nImplemented Based on SOLID Principles\nLazy and Dynamic Modules\nAPI Versioning\nDocumentation\nOpen Source\nLarge & Active CommunityMotivation\n\n\n\nWith this skeleton, we can easily start a server application using Node.js, Nest JS and TypeScript.\n\nRather than spending time on the project setup, get on with the important stuff right away.\n\n\nTake it for a test drive. We'd love to hear any feedback you have or if you've thought of a new feature.\nCommon Features\n\nQuick start\nIntegrated ESLint, Prettier and Husky\nCommon Error Handler\nSimple and Standard scaffolding\nProduction-Ready Skeleton\nFollowed SOLID PrinciplesGetting started\n\n\nSkeleton for REST API applications written in Node JS & Nest JS with TypeScript\nPrerequisites\n\nNode https://nodejs.org/en/ use the LTS version\nNPM\nDocker https://www.docker.com/\nInstall Docker Desktop for MAC: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/\nInstall Docker Desktop for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/\n\n\nDocker Compose\nNestJS CLI https://nestjs.com/\n\nCreate Development Environment\nTo get started, clone the repository to your local computer. Use the following command to run in your terminal.\nClone The Application\n// clone the application\n$ git clone https://github.com/NeoSOFT-Technologies/rest-node-nestjs.gitQuick Installation\nNext, install the packages that are required for this project.\n// Install the required npm modules\n$ npm installCreate The Environment Variables\nThe .env file should be placed in root folder with the following variables.\n# .env.example\n\nAPP_NAME=rest_api\nNODE_ENV=dev\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nDB_DATABASE=rest_api\nDB_USER=user\nDB_PASSWORD=root\nDB_PORT=3306Start MySQL Database\nIn order to use mysql, you need to have it installed in your local machine.\nDocker Compose is what we will be using in our case, In the project directory, execute the following command.\n# build images, create and run containers in background\ndocker-compose up -dIn order to apply your modified code to a running container, you should add a build option.\n# if source code is changed, rebuild image, recreate and start container\ndocker-compose up -d --buildRunning the app\n# development\n$ npm run start\n\n# watch mode\n$ npm run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ npm run start:prodTest\nFor this project, I chose Jest as our test framework.\nWhile Mocha is probably more common, Mocha seems to be looking for a new maintainer and setting up TypeScript testing in Jest is wicked simple.\n# unit tests\n$ npm run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ npm run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ npm run test:covRunning the build\nAll the different build steps are orchestrated via npm scripts.\nNpm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.\nThis is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.\nIf you open package.json, you will see a scripts section with all the different scripts you can call.\nTo call a script, simply run npm run  from the command line.\nYou'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.\nBelow is a list of all the scripts this template has available:\n\n\n\nNpm Script\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbuild\nFull build. Runs ALL build tasks\n\n\nstart:debug\nPerforms a full build and then serves the app in watch mode\n\n\nlint\nRuns ESLint on project files\n\n\nformat\nRuns the file formatter\n\n\nserve\nRuns node on dist/server.js which is the apps entry point\n\n\nstart\nDoes the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with npm start\n\n\ntest\nRuns tests using Jest test runner\n\n\ntest:watch\nRuns tests in watch mode\n\n\ndoc\nGenerate the project documenation using compdoc\n\n\n\nProject Structure\nIn a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate source  and distributable files.\nTypeScript (.ts) files live in your src folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (.js) in the dist folder.\nThe test and views folders remain top level as expected.\nPlease find below a detailed description of the app's folder structures:\n\nNote! Make sure you have already built the app using  npm run build\n\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n.vscode\nContains VS Code specific settings\n\n\n.github\nContains GitHub settings and configurations, including the GitHub Actions workflows\n\n\ndist\nContains the distributable (or output) from your TypeScript build. This is the code you ship\n\n\nnode_modules\nContains all your npm dependencies\n\n\nsrc\nContains your source code that will be compiled to the dist dir\n\n\nsrc/config\nHere you will find all the environment configuration necessary to access the application\n\n\nsrc/components\nComponents define group of files/source that respond to various module(http requests)\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/dto/\nDTO (Data Transfer Object) Schema, Validation\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/entities/\nEntities belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/repository/\nRepository belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/services/\nServices belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/module_name.controllers.ts\nController belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/module_name.module.ts\nModule belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/core\nAll core modules - Guards, Http Request & Response Handler, Logger\n\n\nsrc/main.ts\nEntry point to your express app\n\n\ntest\nContains your tests. Separate from source because there is a different build process.\n\n\n.env.example\nAPI keys, tokens, passwords, database URI. Clone this, but don't check it in to public repos.\n\n\npackage.json\nFile that contains npm dependencies\n\n\ntsconfig.json\nConfig settings for compiling server code written in TypeScript\n\n\ntsconfig.build.json\nConfig settings for compiling tests written in TypeScript\n\n\n.eslintrc\nConfig settings for ESLint code style checking\n\n\n.eslintignore\nConfig settings for paths to exclude from linting\n\n\n\nDocumentations\n1. Generation with compdoc\nGenerate project documentation using the following command (npm 6 is required for npx support). See the official documentation for more options.\nnpm run doc\nOR\nnpx @compodoc/compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s\n2. Request and Response Cycle\n\nAn explanation of how the request and response cycle works is provided here\n\n2.1 Request and Response Workflow\n\nBoilerplate has a custom guard enabled for handling response and request for every api. The integration of request response guard is enabled by default with response structure\n\n\n2.2 Request Workflow\n\nBy creating a workflow, you can specify the template that should be used to create a change request when a request for service is logged.\n\n\n3. Modules\n\nLogger\n\nRequest Response\n\nMailer\n\nDatabase\n\nPattern\n4. Miscellaneous\n\nKnown Issues\n\nGit commits\n\nClean Docker Images\n\nInstallation Pretteri, Husky & Lint\n\n\n5.

Please adhere to these git commit\nmessage guidelines\nor your code is unlikely be merged into the main project.

We need to provide SMTP credentials in .env in the desired format mentioned below.\nMailer module also supports the attachment functionality.\nWe need to define the email template folder from where we need fetch the email template.\nCurrently we support pug email templates\n\nConfiguration\nTo configure the SMTP service we need to add below values in the environment. The values are self explanatory.  \nDB_PORT=\nMAIL_HOST=\nMAIL_SECURE=\nMAIL_USER=\nMAIL_PASSWORD=\nMAIL_PORT=To configure our email template directory we need add EMAIL_TEMPLATE_FOLDER in the environment.\nEMAIL_TEMPLATE_FOLDER=Usability\nSince Mailer is not required in every module it is not part of the CoreModule imports. To leverage the functionality you need to import the MailService and MailModule from core module\n    import { MailModule } from '@libs/core/modules/mail/ mail.module';Then we need to provide MailModule as a import and MailService as a provider to our Module\n@Module({\n  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],\n  providers: [UsersService],\n  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User]), **MailModule**],\n  providers: [UsersService, **MailService**],\n  controllers: [UsersController],\n})\nNext, we need to add MailService as dependency \nconstructor(private readonly mailService: MailService) {} \nFinally to trigger an email, we need pass below parameters to sendMail function in MailService\n await this.mailService.sendMail({\n        to: 'ethan.reynolds@neosofttech.com', // list of receivers\n        from: 'noreply@nestjs.com', // sender address\n        subject: 'Testing Nest MailerModule ✔', // Subject line\n        // text: 'welcome', // plaintext body\n        //html: 'welcome', // HTML body content\n        template: './templates/welcome', // HTML body content\n        context: {\n          name: 'Ethan Reynolds',\n          phoneNo: +12653651478,\n          date: new Date(),\n        },\n      });\ntemplate: Path of email template in folder structure eg. if welcome.pug is located in /templates/welcome.pug then the value would be './templates/welcome'\n\n\ncontext: Email template variable that need to dynamically parsed inside the email template\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/modules/database.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/modules/database.html","title":"additional-page - Database","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nDatabase\nBoiler plate has already included mysql database configuration with the core modules. To leverage the functionality, we need to define the database connection in config.ts. Update the database configuration as per your setting.\n\nNote: It is a best practice to import database information from environment.\n\n\n\nentities:   Entities that maps with database table.\n\n\nsynchronize:   Synchronize the entities with databases. Should not be enabled for production.\n\nUsing other database apart from MySQL.\nThe existing boiler plate comes with by default support for MySQL. This doesn't mean that you cannot use any other database like MongoDB,Postgres etc. Install the respective package of the database and update the config.ts as per required database configuration.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/modules/pattern.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/modules/pattern.html","title":"additional-page - Pattern","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nDesign Pattern\nClean architecture\n\nSeparation of concerns at the architectural level\n\nThis document defines the design pattern for developing any web api application. We intend to follow clean architecture. Dividing the application into multiple layers like Domain layer, Service layer, Repository layer etc. The implementation of these layer would explained via example. For more understanding kindly refer Clean Architecture related articles.\nIn this boiler plate, we define the methods and techniques that would useful for building and maintaining web app build in NestJS. NestJS itself has covered alot techniques like TypeORM, Dependency Injection and so on. This document help us to utilize functionality and follow clean architecture.\n\nIn the above diagram, we code the see the how does the request flows from controller to database. There are lot of aspects that need to consider in this, like external api calls, caching etc which would be covered later.\nInversion of Control (IoC)\nIn software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. IoC inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.\nBelow is the inversion of flow for the boiler plate which has been used for user module.\n\nThe control flows from UserController to UserService, we have DTO defined for transfering data between classes eg. create.user.dto, update.user.dto\nUnderstanding the implementation of clean code in boilerplate\nTo start with let's understand the folder structure and files first.\n\nApp.module — the core of the project, here we import modules that are providing functionalities.\nusers.module — this module will be imported by AppModule to provide everything that is related to our users.\nusers.controller — Here we declare our endpoints with all parameters.\nentities — in this place we declare our User class.\ndto— data transfer object — a bunch of interfaces for communication with the application.\nrepository — in this place we define all the queries related to database or external IO.\nservices - in this place we have our business logic defined\nNow let us go through each folder\n1. entities\nIn this folder, we have defined the database table fields that is required for that entity. TypeORM has some build-in helpers like PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column etc. Ref: TypeORM documentation\n2. dto\nIn this folder, we have defined the the data transfer object that would be used to communicated between classes. DTO are helpful for avoid leak of unwanted data or fields\n3. repository\nIn this folder, we have defined the database queries related to the entity. We have used typeORM for fetching or saving data. Before defining the implementation of the repository, it is a good practice to define an interface of the repository.\n4. services\nIn this folder, we have defined the business logic related to the entity. For executing the db queries, we use the repository. Repository and services are loosely coupled with the repository interface.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/miscellaneous.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/miscellaneous.html","title":"additional-page - Miscellaneous","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nKnown Issues\nGit commits\nClean Docker Images\nInstallation Pretteri, Husky & Lint\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/miscellaneous/git-commits.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/miscellaneous/git-commits.html","title":"additional-page - Git commits","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nGit commits and pre hooks\nWe have added some git pre hooks while committing the code.
